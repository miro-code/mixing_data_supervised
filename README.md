# mixing_data_supervised

Experiments on mixing mnist and gtsrb datasets to see if it serves as pretraining. 

I want to find out whether we can quantify impact of different classes on downstream tasks for comprehensive pretraining using small scale evaluations that constist of small scale pretraining and one-epoch fine-tuning.
